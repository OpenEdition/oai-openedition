OpenEdition OAI-PMH repository Documentation 
============================================

.. image:: _static/openedition.png

The OpenEdition OAI-PMH repository provides metadata of the documents published on `OpenEdition Books <https://books.openedition.org>`_, `OpenEdition Journals <https://journals.openedition.org>`_, `Hypotheses <https://hypotheses.org>`_, and `Calenda <http://calenda.org>`_.

The repository is available online at https://oai.openedition.org.

.. warning::

    From January 2024, the repository uses the https protocol. Requests to http://oai.openedition.org are redirected to https://oai.openedition.org. Some OAI harvesters do not support HTTP redirection. In this case, the repository url must be updated to https://oai.openedition.org in the harvester.


It uses the version 2.0 of the OAI-PMH protocol. 

This documentation describes the specific elements related to OpenEdition but does not include the usual recommendations of the OAI-PMH protocol (available on the Open Archives Initiative website: http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/openarchivesprotocol.html).
