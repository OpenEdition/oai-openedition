XML Validation
=================

Some ``dcterms`` elements used in ``qdc`` and ``mets`` formats have a ``scheme`` attribute. The usage of this attribute isn't valid against the schema but we have chosen to keep it so as not to break the use made of it by our partners. With this exception, the XML is valid.

About the usage of the ``scheme`` attribute, see the DCMI website this note: http://dublincore.org/documents/dc-xml-guidelines/#note2
