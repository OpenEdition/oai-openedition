XML Validation
=================


.. warning::

   Version 1 of the OAI-PMH repository is DEPRECIATED. Please refer to the warning on the :ref:`home page <home>`.


Some ``dcterms`` elements used in ``qdc`` and ``mets`` formats have a ``scheme`` attribute. The usage of this attribute isn't valid against the schema but we have chosen to keep it so as not to break the use made of it by our partners. With this exception, the XML is valid.

About the usage of the ``scheme`` attribute, see this note on the DCMI website: http://dublincore.org/documents/dc-xml-guidelines/#note2
